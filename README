petstoretest project
====================

In order to design and implement the test, It has been divided in one test of two scenarios:
1.- user can get the list of available pets
2.- simulate main API instructions for creating, editing and deleting a pet.


Execution instructions:
=======================

In order to launch the tests, using maven, use the next launch command in the main folder:

_$ mvn test


How to approach testing this site in a real project
====================================================

The test should be as short as possible and re-usably, therefore the best approach should be divide it in small tests:
- assert all API methods, individually, asserting all kind of responses possibles for each method.
- assert security for all API methods, the user should access the data only if provides the api-key correctly if needed.

In order to do this tests, the code should have a good library set, to work better with error managements, 
objects information and API helpers.
